Hey there!

I'm the Founder & CEO of [TruStory](https://www.trustory.io/), a social network where experts debate the authenticity of claims people make online.

I'm a self-taught engineer. I got obsessed with coding one day and decided to teach myself how to code in 3 months. I was hooked and never looked back. 

Yeah, so, you see, I have an _obsessive_ personality. **All or nothing** is my motto. After all, life is short and we have limited time to do all the things we want do in life. So what's the point of doing something if I am not doing it with all my heart and passion, right?

Except..doing everything with an "all or nothing" attitude also gets me into trouble sometimes (e.g. I am obsessed with Almond butter and eat 3 cans per week. This can't be good for me?). Okay anyways. Getting back to my story. 

So, as I was saying, I got obsessed with coding. Learning to code was the best decision I made in my life. It was the first time I fell in love with ‚Äúwork‚Äù. I can't say I was an amazing programmer. Not even close. In fact, I got a lot of rejections from companies like Google and Airbnb and lots more. But the reason it was the best decision is because it gave me access to an underworld I was dying to have access to. It gave me the ability to finally learn how things work at a fundamental level, down to the bytes. I often felt debilitated because I couldn't truly understand how technology worked. Learning to code gave me the freedom to learn, explore and understand. Looking back, I can't imagine not having this skillset.

Now that I am building my own company, I don't code day to day anymore. So what exactly do I do?

Well, subscribe to my newsletter (on the front page of this blog) to find out üòä

I'm running out of steam talking about myself. I'll get back to this later.
