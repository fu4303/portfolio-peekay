Hey there!

![](/media/20180906_dre_coinbase_0505_new.jpg)

I'm the Founder & CEO of [TruStory](https://www.trustory.io/). We're building a social network where experts debate the authenticity of claims people make online.

## **My journey**

I'm a self-taught engineer turned entrepreneur. 

_A little bit about my journey below:_

I [was once](https://www.linkedin.com/in/preethi-kasireddy-41383528/) a banker at Goldman Sachs and investor at Andreessen Horowitz. 

But then one day I [got obsessed with coding](https://www.preethikasireddy.com/posts/why-i-left-the-best-job-in-the-world/) and decided to teach myself how to code in 3 months. I was hooked and never looked back. 

Yeah, so, you see, I have an _obsessive_ personality. **All or nothing** is my motto. After all, life is short and we have a very limited time to do all the things we want do in life. So what's the point of doing something if I don't do it with all my heart and passion, right?

So, as I was saying, I got obsessed with coding. Learning to code was the best decision I made in my life. It was the first time I fell in love with ‚Äúwork‚Äù. I can't say I was an amazing programmer. Not even close. In fact, I got a lot of rejections from companies like Google and Airbnb and lots more. I eventually [landed a job at Coinbase](https://www.preethikasireddy.com/posts/what-happened-after-i-left-the-best-job-in-the-world-to-become-an-engineer/) as a software engineer. 

Many people have asked me why I would turn away an amazing career to go learn to code. They told me it was the wrong thing to do. It didn't align with a typical career path. Honestly, I'm glad I didn't listen to these people because learning to code was 100% worth it. It gave me access to an underworld I was dying to have access to. It gave me the ability to [finally learn how things work](https://www.preethikasireddy.com/posts/how-the-web-works-a-primer-for-newcomers-to-web-development-or-anyone-really/) at a fundamental level, [down to the bytes](https://www.preethikasireddy.com/posts/a-beginner-friendly-introduction-to-containers-vms-and-docker/). I no longer felt debilitated by not being able to understand [how things worked](https://www.preethikasireddy.com/posts/how-does-ethereum-work-anyway/). 

In short, learning to code gave me the freedom to learn, explore and truly understand. It's a superpower that I wholeheartedly cherish.

## What now

I spend all my time building my company, [TruStory](https://www.trustory.io/), and don't code day to day anymore.  

So what exactly do I do?
