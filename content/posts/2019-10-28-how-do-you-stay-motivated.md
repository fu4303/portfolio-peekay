Many people struggle with motivation. They have a deep desire to do more and to be better but they lack the motivation to do so.

As a result, they end up living a life where they know that they have "potential" but never choose to pursue it. This leads to a mediocre life at best.

## The answer

My answer to _"How do you stay motivated?"_ is simple:

I don‚Äôt try to "stay motivated". **I take** **action**. **The** **motivation follows**.

**Many people have this backward, thinking we must wait for motivation to drive us to act.**

But that‚Äôs not how it works. Motivation is not a force magically appears on its own. It‚Äôs a¬†**force that must be created through action**. Motivation is a reaction to action. Hence, the only way to gain motivation is to take action. Otherwise, the motivation you‚Äôre waiting for will never come.

Let‚Äôs look at an example...

## Why is going to the gym so dreadful at times?

Have you ever planned to go to the gym but then began to **deeply dread** the idea of going? You know deep down that going to the gym is the right thing to do, even if it‚Äôs the last thing you want to do in the moment.

So what do you do? You start to distract yourself. You check your phone for new notifications. You read useless stuff on the internet. You grab a snack from the refrigerator.

Before you know it, you‚Äôve killed another hour. At this point, going to the gym feels even more dreadful. There are a million other things you‚Äôd rather do or that all of a sudden ‚Äúneed‚Äù to get done.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to go right now. I have a lot of other things to do,‚Äù¬†you tell yourself.

If you think you‚Äôre the only one feeling this way, here‚Äôs the good news: You are not. Everyone, including the most successful people, feels that sense of dread when there are things they **have** to do but don‚Äôt **want** to do. But guess what? They do them anyway.

So how do they do it?

## Don‚Äôt overthink it

We had a really big dinner last night at a hotel buffet. The food was impressive for a buffet, so I ended up getting multiple plates of food. There was an open bar too, and I ended up drinking four glasses of wine. And on top of all that, we ended on a sweet note with dessert.

The whole meal took close to three hours. By the end of it, I was stuffed and satisfied. üòä

When I finally got back to my hotel room, I told myself that I‚Äôd go to the gym in the morning and do a quick 20-minute sprint workout. Nothing fancy. One minute on, one minute off ‚Äî 10 times, for a total of 20 minutes.

Since I had a big meal that night, I would have a lot of fuel in me to have a killer sprint workout. So I set my alarm to 7:00 a.m. with a plan to hit the gym at 7:30 a.m. Collapsing on the bed, I fell asleep in minutes.

The next morning, my alarm rang exactly at 7:00 a.m. (obviously). I woke up but frankly had no desire to go down to the gym to sprint. I was still a bit tired and felt a heavy and lethargic from the wine. I simply didn‚Äôt want to go.

So I snoozed the alarm. üò¥

Fifteen minutes later, the alarm woke me up again. And I snoozed it again.

Another 15 minutes passed, and the alarm rang again.

An inner voice in my brain still kept saying¬†**no**. It wanted me to sleep some more, but my heart wanted my ass to get up and go.

So what did I do? Did I listen to my brain? Or my heart?

My heart. Obviously.

Rather than letting myself think about not wanting to do, I got my ass out of bed, got dressed, and dragged my ass down to the gym.

Within five minutes of being on the treadmill, my brain shut off, and I sprinted my heart out. I was in flow and totally forgot about how tired and sleepy I was.

So what‚Äôs the takeaway?

**Motivation comes to those who take action.**

Motivation is when we have a deep desire to take action. If you want to gain motivation, you HAVE to take action.

I realize this is a **self-fulfilling prophecy**, but that‚Äôs exactly the point.

**When you act, you build momentum. Then a force propels you to take even more action, which builds more momentum. And so on.** It‚Äôs a virtuous cycle. A positive feedback loop.

On the other hand, when you don‚Äôt act, you create zero momentum. Instead, you create space for other things. Oftentimes, this space is filled with thinking about the action. Your brain starts to analyze what you need to do and thinks about all the ways it sucks and could go wrong.

Soon enough, fear and anxiety kick in. At this point, you‚Äôve created negative momentum. And this is when you begin to dread doing the thing.

**The longer you sit around waiting for motivation, the less of it you'll have.**

That‚Äôs not to say you should always act immediately and without thinking about actions you take. For example, let‚Äôs say you need to have a tough conversation with your boyfriend or girlfriend about ending the relationship. You‚Äôre probably afraid of hurting them and afraid of hurting yourself. You‚Äôd likely have little motivation to have this conversation, even though you know you need to have it.

So what should you do? Not think and just act and get it over with?

No. Because thinking about how to carry out conversation will help you handle the situation appropriately and not be reckless with the other person‚Äôs feelings. But there‚Äôs a difference between thinking about doing something versus thinking about the action. You can spend weeks, months, or years thinking about doing something and never get anywhere.

So first, **commit yourself to action**. Set the date and location that you plan to have this conversation. And don‚Äôt let yourself back down on this commitment to take action. Don‚Äôt cheat yourself.

Only then should you allow your brain to start thinking about the action itself.

Essentially, you‚Äôve shifted your mind from thinking, _‚ÄúUgh, I don't want to have this conversation,‚Äù_ to _‚ÄúAll right, what will I actually say during this conversation‚Äù_. The former is unproductive thinking, while the latter is productive thinking. See the difference? üòä

## Conclusion

**The ‚Äúsecret‚Äù to motivation is action. The reason you‚Äôre ‚Äúnot feeling motivated‚Äù is due to inaction.** 

Don‚Äôt make it more complicated than that.

Stop reading. And take action.
