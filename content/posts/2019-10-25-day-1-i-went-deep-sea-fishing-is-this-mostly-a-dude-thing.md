Today was the **first day of my 2-week break** (In case you missed it, I shared a [short update](https://twitter.com/iam_preethi/status/1183567353998503937?s=20) last night on why I’m taking a break.)

Frankly, I’m **still unwinding**. I’m guessing it’ll take at least 3 to 5 days before I actually feel like I’m on “break”. Right now, I’m half here and half not. I’m half thinking about my obligations and half trying not to. Le Sigh.

None the less, Day 1 was fun. I went **Deep Sea Fishing**. 😆

I had never been deep sea fishing before. In fact, I’ve never been fishing, period. It was not something my dad ever took me to do when I was a child.

Plus, it is **not really a sport that women seem to gravitate towards** (at least, I don’t think so?).

But I’m a huge **adrenaline junkie** and my definition of a “break” is doing a bunch of physical adventurous stuff until I tire myself out and can't move. So I was excited to try out Deep Sea Fishing as the first of many adventures.

I live in Los Angeles so there is plenty of water all around me. It must mean there should be plenty of places to fish nearby, right?

Wrong.

We did **hours of research**, only to find that most fishing spots in California had not updated their website in years. They honestly looked like they were built before JavaScript was invented and not touched ever since. 🙄

_“WTF?”_ we thought.

Eventually, after hours of scouring the internet, we found one place that looked legit. **Chanel Islands.**

It was close by (about a 1.5 hour drive). And the fishing reports said they had **plenty of fish**.

_“We'll take it,”_ we said.

3 days later, we were on our way to Chanel Islands. We drove up the night before because driving up on the day of would have been a nightmare. When you go fishing, you have to show up early AF. **Like, 5am early**. 😬

We figured we may as well explore and enjoy the night in Chanel Islands. Then get up early and go fishing.

So we got here around 7pm last night. Checked into our hotel. Unpacked. And decided to hit the town.

Chanel Islands is a quaint little town. It’s **beautiful, clean, and private**. The population is less than 4,000 people!!! That is 400,000x smaller than Los Angeles. 🤣

As we were driving around, I realized how much **I miss living in a small town**.

Growing up, the town we lived in was also sparsely populated. Every home was REQUIRED to have a minimum of 3 acres of land. It was unbelievably spacious, beautiful, and serene. We had deer running through our backyard daily. And would even hear an occasional bear howl at night.

Every time I go back home, I feel **at peace**. There is honestly nothing like it. **The privacy**. **The greenery. The fresh air.** All of it just feels like home.

Being in the city doesn’t give me the same sense of being at home. When I’m ready to buy my first home, it’ll definitely NOT be in a big city. It’ll be in a rural place where I can get a ton of land and be surrounded by nature and animals.

Anyways. I digress.

So we explored Chanel Islands a bit and ended up at this impeccable Brazilian restaurant. Gosh, was it delicious. Fried plantains. Rice. Seafood. More fried plantains for dessert. Yum.

Not long after, I had a wonderful food coma and crashed. 😴

I woke up the next morning at **4am and went for a short run.**

Whenever I go to new cities, I go for runs early in the morning. Why?

Well, two things.

One, I get a quick **workout** in.

Two, it gives me an opportunity to wonder the local streets and alleys and **explore** different pockets of the city while everyone else is asleep.

It can be **scary** sometimes because it is pitch dark and no one is around. All I usually hear is my own footsteps and the wind whistling through the trees.

It makes me feel **vulnerable** because anything can happen. I can get kidnapped. Or eaten by a snake. Or fall into an ocean. Who knows?!

But for real, I love the **challenge and trill** of a morning run. In the modern **Life of Comfort and Abundance**, inducing doses of **challenge and risk** in our lives is necessary to make us feel alive.

I ran close to 3 miles and saw a grand total of 3 cars and 0 people. Just how I like it. 😌

I then ran back home, showered, and jetted to the harbor. Despite it being 40 degrees outside, it was too beautiful to complain.

We spent **10 hours** fishing. And I caught my first fish within 5 minutes! I caught **5 fish** in total. Not bad, right?!?

**Fishing is a game of patience, vigilance, and luck**. Luck you have no control over. Patience and Vigilance you do.

I **highly recommend everyone go fishing at least once**. Practicing patience and vigilance in this day and age is more important than ever. Especially given how addicted most people to constant stream of dopamine. Fishing is the complete opposite.

Some random thoughts:

**1) Protected fish**

There were a lot of times when people on the boat would catch fish and the Fisherman would tell them to throw it back in the water.

Why?

Because certain fish are protected and it’s illegal to catch them. For example, some species cannot be fished until they are a certain size. Others are completely off guard.

It’s nice to see people giving a fuck about the environment.

**2) Fishing is mostly men**

Fishing seems to be a man thing. 95% of the people on the boat were men. No joke.

Why?

Well, for one, it’s dirty and smelly, and generally girls do not enjoy things that are dirty and smelly.

Second, it’s a very atypical social experience. Women generally love to socialize in groups. Men do too. But Men also enjoy being in isolation. I rarely meet women who travel alone. There are some, but it’s not common. On the other hand, it’s not uncommon to see men traveling alone.

My gut tells me that the reason fishing is mostly a dude sport is because it’s a very isolated, solo experience. Something that men deeply enjoy.

This is just my guess. I’d love to hear your thoughts. 🙂

**3) Eating food with Fish-scaled-hands can be grossly fun**

When I first hopped on the boat, the food in the little kitchen looked so unappetizing. It was dirty and everywhere smelled like a mix of fish and bird poop.

_“Yuck,”_ I thought. “There is no way I’m putting this in my mouth. I’ll wait till we get off this boat.”

But after hours of fishing, I got ravenous. So of course, I gave in. I ordered a Pastrami Sandwich.

GOD HOT DAMN. It was the best Pastrami Sandwich I’ve had EVER in my entire life. Hands down.

And the best part? We were eating our sandwiches with dirty, smelly fish-scaled hands. In normal land, this would be absolutely gross. But being on the boat made this experience surreal. Gross, I know. But trust me, every lick was worth it.

After I finished eating, I turned to the old Fisherman who was sitting near me and asked:

_“What do you do with the fish you catch everyday? There is no way you eat it all.”_

_“I eat a couple of em. I give some to my neighbor. Last week, I gave em’ to my Gardner. Ain't nothing like fresh fish. I live and die for this.”_ He responded.

Damn. Okay. Well, I’m excited to go cook the fish I caught and see whether it’s truly to die for 😉
