Web developers have plenty to be thankful for when it comes to learning resources.

Beginners can feast on hundreds of courses on sites like [TreeHouse](http://www.teamtreehouse.com), [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/) and [Egghead.io](http://egghead.io), alongside dozens of immersive bootcamps like [Hack Reactor](http://www.hackreactor.com) and [App Academy](http://www.appacademy.io).

Advanced programmers, meanwhile, are supported by a thriving ecosystem of blog posts, OSS projects, books and papers.

Even still, web development is no easy skill to pick up (and more importantly, stick with). I receive emails from beginners every day who have a deep desire to learn programming but are struggling in one way or another.

One of the factors holding back students is the ‚Äúcontent gap‚Äù‚Ää‚Äî‚Äästrong resources for beginners, good communities for advanced developers, but surprisingly little content for intermediate developers in the middle.

This is exactly where a lot of programmers fall off‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthey learn the basics, but fall through the cracks as they advance to building real-world applications or working on complex teams. This is one of the reasons I‚Äôve tried to [focus my own blog posts on intermediate skills](https://medium.com/@preethikasireddy).

In 2017, my goal is to continue writing blog posts and written content focused on this middle ground. And I‚Äôm seeking your input on what areas you feel I should write more about:

* What are some JavaScript **concepts or technologies** that you wish there was a **better explanation** for? (eg. Prototypal inheritance in JavaScript, scope and closures, ES6, Observables, React, Webpack, CSS, etc.)
* What **aspects of building a real world application** do you find most **difficult or unclear**? (eg. Set-up, Authentication, Testing, Picking the right tools and frameworks, etc.)
* What **topics do you want to learn more about** but find limited good resources to learn from?
* Have you ever **struggled with a topic or technology** so much that it caused you to give up? Which ones?

I appreciate everyone who reads my posts and would love to hear from you. Respond in the comments below, or shoot me an email at preethi@preethireddy.com.

I can‚Äôt wait to hear your responses and tackle new coding challenges in 2017! üôÇ
